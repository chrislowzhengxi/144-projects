This stage seems less consuming than stage 2, but in terms of difficulty
it's also very horrible. 

The biggest challenge is to decode. Once you figure out the logic, there are still 
a bunch of issues such as the \n chracter in the end that's crashing my code.
Still don't know how to do this at all and I spent at least 12 hours debugging, 
with TAs having no clue at all. Don't really know what to do, except keep on 
modifying the EOF to no avail. 

No idea how to let the cases pass and seems like it's only working for the simplest of
cases, which is a bit unfortunate considering how much time I actually sacrificed 
and put in to this project.
