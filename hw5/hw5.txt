Any process is allocated 3 MB of contiguous memory in the lowest possible address 
range. 

A. Yes. P1 will be in the lowest available address range that can fit 3 MB, which
is addresses 0-2 within the free region 0-4. Although P1 only needs 1 MB, it will
be allocated and loaded into the range 0-2 (due to the 3 MB allocation). 


B. Yes. P2 requires 2 MB of memory but will also be allocated a contiguous 3 MB 
block. 0, 1, 2, and 5 are occupied, 3-4 is not enough for 3 MB. The next lowest 
available address range is 6-8. Therefore, P2 will be loaded in the address range
6 to 8. 


C. No. P3 requires 3 MB of contiguous memory. The only remaining free memory is
at address 9. There is no contiguous 3 MB block available. 


D. 
P1: Allocated memory is 3 MB. Memory required is 1 MB. The internal fragmentation 
is 3 MB - 1 MB = 2 MB. 

P2: Allocated memory is 3 MB. Memory required is 2 MB. The internal fragmentation
is 3 MB - 2 MB = 1 MB. 

P3: It is never loaded, so there is no meaningful answer. However, if it were loaded, 
the internal fragmentation would have been 0 MB. 

The total internal fragmentation is 2 MB + 1 MB = 3 MB. 


E. External fragmentation is the total amount of free memory that can't 
satisfy a memory allocation request. 

Addreses 0-2 is for P1, addresses 6-8 is for P2, and address 5 is occupied. 
This means that the free memory blocks are addresses 3-4 and address 9. 
This gives us a total free memory (external fragmentation) of 2 MB + 1 MB = 3 MB.

B. We have 8-addressing. 1 bit is used for the segment number, and 7 bits is 
used for the offset. With 7 bits, the offset can represent values from 0 to 127. 
Therefore, the largest possible segment size is (2^7) or 128 bytes.
