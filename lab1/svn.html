<h1>Handing in work for <a href="https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/59113">cs144-aut-24</a></h1>


<ol>
<li> This page covers how we use
<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>
and the command-line tool "svn" in cs144, used
to distribute files to you and to receive your finished work.
Remember that the <a href="http://csil.cs.uchicago.edu/">CSIL</a> Linux
machines are the <b>only</b> machines we support for compiling
and running code in cs144.

<ul>
<li>
There are svn tutorials online, including
<a href="http://www.clear.rice.edu/comp314/svn.html">here</a>, and
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/westmont-risk/wiki/SvnTutorial">here</a>.
 You can search for
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=svn+tutorial">svn tutorial</a> and
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=svn+tutorial">svn introduction</a> to find others.

The canonical reference is <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">the
SVN book here</a>, which includes
<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/index.html">HTML</a> and
<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn-book.pdf">PDF</a>
versions; you might want to review
<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.basic.html">Chapter
1</a>.
</li><li>(by the way, for <a href="https://github.com/">git</a> users: we use svn
because the centralized model makes more sense for this class,
and because svn is simpler. Please refrain from creating
git forks of svn repositories; the results are impossible to debug.)
</li></ul>


</li><li> We run <a href="https://phoenixforge.cs.uchicago.edu/">Phoenixforge</a>
to manage the subversion repositories in the class.  Your use of
phoenixforge, and the svn commands that connect to phoenixforge, is
authenticated with your
University <a href="http://itservices.uchicago.edu/services/cnetid">CNetID</a>
and its password.  You need to know your own CNetID.  It is not
a six-digit number.

</li><li>As a registered student in cs144, you should have a repository
automatically created for you called "<tt>CNETID-cs144-aut-24</tt>", where
CNETID is your
own <a href="http://itservices.uchicago.edu/services/cnetid">CNetID</a>. You
hand in files for this class by adding and committing files to this
svn repository. We create sub-directories in this repository for
each assignment that requires you to hand in files.  The creation of
per-student repositories is done
automatically and periodically, based on the electronically accessible
course registration information at that time.

</li><li> Check that you have a <tt>CNETID-cs144-aut-24</tt> repository on Phoenixforge.
<ul>
<li> Go to
<a href="https://phoenixforge.cs.uchicago.edu/projects/cs144-aut-24/">the web page for
<tt>cs144-aut-24</tt></a>.
You should be able to login with your CNetID and its password.
<tt>cs144-aut-24</tt> is the "parent" for all students, TAs, and professors in cs144.
Aside from this check, you won't need to worry about it.  On the left, find and
click on the link for "CNETID-cs144-aut-24", where <tt>CNETID</tt> is your CNetID.
Then, under "Overview" on the left,
you should see "Sub Project for YOUR NAME in cs144 2023", where "YOUR NAME"
is your name.

</li><li> The URL for the web view of your svn project is
<blockquote>
<tt>https://phoenixforge.cs.uchicago.edu/projects/CNETID-cs144-aut-24</tt>
</blockquote>
where <tt>CNETID</tt> is your CNetID.  You can also copy that URL into
a new browser window or tab, replacing <tt>CNETID</tt> with your CNetID.
You don't want to see
<font style="color: #860004; background-color: #fee3e3">The page you
were trying to access doesn't exist or has been removed</font>.
Make sure your CNetID has been typed correctly.
</li></ul>
If you believe you are registered for the
course, but do not see a repository created for you,
ask a question (private to the instructors if you wish)
 <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/68356/discussion/">On ED</a> and put it in the "svn" folder.

</li><li> To create a directory for your cs144-aut-24 work on the CSIL Linux machines,
use a command-line shell to run:
<blockquote><pre>cd ~
mkdir cs144
chmod 700 cs144
cd cs144
</pre></blockquote>
The <tt>chmod</tt> command is to ensure that you and only you can see the
contents of your <tt>cs144</tt> directory.
Then, AFTER REPLACING "<tt>CNETID</tt>" with your CNetID:
<blockquote><pre>svn co https://phoenixforge.cs.uchicago.edu/svn/CNETID-cs144-aut-24
</pre></blockquote>
After typing that, you may be prompted to accept the SSL
certificate for the phoenixforge server. Enter 'p' to permanently
accept it. Then, you will be prompted for your password. Enter
your CNetID password.  Now your local <tt>CNETID-cs144-aut-24</tt> directory
is your checkout of your individual <tt>CNETID-cs144-aut-24</tt> repository.

</li><li>From then on you really only need to know three or four svn commands.  You
execute these commands from within the directories created by the <tt>svn co</tt>
commands above.  <br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>For your <tt><i>CNetID</i>-cs144-aut-24</tt> project, you'll need:
<blockquote><pre>svn update
</pre></blockquote>
to see files that we distribute to you.
You will get announcements via ED when you have to do this.
For every assignment, we will create and add a directory for that assignment
in your repository, seeded with any necessary files for that assignment.
You should never create your own per-assignment
directory.  To add (hand-in) file X within a per-assignment directory, you first need to do
<blockquote><pre>svn add X
</pre></blockquote>
once, and then for all subsequent updates to X,
<blockquote><pre>svn commit X
</pre></blockquote>
To see if you have local uncommitted changes, run:
<blockquote><pre>svn status
</pre></blockquote>
This lists files that have uncommitted changes (marked with an "M"), and
files that have not been added or committed (marked with a "?"), called
"untracked" files in SVN.
</li></ul>

</li><li>Remember: <b>you should never create a per-assignment directory
within your <tt><i>CNetID</i>-cs144-aut-24</tt> directory</b>.  After an
assignment is assigned, you do an <tt>svn update</tt> to see whatever
new directories and files are necessary.  If you do try to create a
directory, for example <tt>hw1</tt>, when <tt>hw1</tt> has already
been created by the cs144 instructors, you will get cryptic error
messages when you try to <tt>svn add hw1</tt>, with something like:
"<tt><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3601669/svn-405-method-not-allowed">Server sent unexpected return value (405 Method Not Allowed)
in response to MKCOL request</a></tt>" This is how you know that you
created and tried to add a directory that had already been created for
you.  Move the directory in question to somewhere else entirely
(e.g. "<tt>mv hw1 ~</tt>"), do the "<tt>svn
update</tt>" to get the correct directory, copy whatever
important files you have in <tt>~/hw1</tt> into the new
correct <tt>hw1</tt>, "<tt>svn add</tt>" and "<tt>svn
commit</tt>" those files, and then "<tt>rm -rf
~/hw1</tt>".

</li><li><b>Because <tt>svn commit</tt> is how you are handing in your work, be
careful with it.  Its proper use is your responsibility.</b>  In particular:<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><b>If you haven't done an <tt>svn add</tt> and <tt>svn commit</tt>, it hasn't been handed in.</b>
Use <tt>svn status</tt> to see uncommitted changes and untracked files.
Make sure that you have done an <tt>svn add</tt> on all the files you want to hand in.
</li><li><b>Double check that the files you think you have handed in,
have really been handed in.</b>
You can look at the contents of your svn repository on the web, at a URL like:
<blockquote>
<tt>https://phoenixforge.cs.uchicago.edu/projects/CNETID-cs144-aut-24/repository</tt>
</blockquote>
but replacing <tt>CNETID</tt> with your CNetID.
</li><li>
To help you, the directories in your <tt>CNETID-cs144-aut-24</tt> project
should include a <tt>00-checkme.html</tt> file that contains a link to a web page that shows
the contents of <i>that directory</i> in the SVN repository.
Use this to confirm what the graders will see when they collect your files, and to make sure that you have
not submitted an empty ("0 Bytes") file by accident.
</li></ul>
