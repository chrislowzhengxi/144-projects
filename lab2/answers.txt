Exercise 1 

add -g flag to make
fix logic in for loop


Exercise 2 

//The length of the data4 array is: 55

line 30          
data4[offset] = data4[i];
(gdb) info locals
offset = 54
i = 109
data = "Xfmm-!nbzc"
stringToPrint = "Some additional text."
data3 = "A final bit of text."
data4 = "Well, maybe just a little uis to eat xl,ijtst loe  un!"

(Notice data4 array gets corrupted at line)
(gdb) step 1
line 28        
for (i = 200; i > 13; i--) {
(gdb) info locals
offset = 54
i = 109
data = "Xfmm-!nbzc"
stringToPrint = "Some additional text."
data3 = "A final bit of text."
data4 = "Well, maybe just a little uis to eat xl,ijtst loe  un", <incomplete sequence \372>


Exercise 3

1. 0x24 bytes are being reserved for locals on the stack.
   This is shown in the instruction "sub $0x24, %esp".

2. "topsecret". It can be displayed with the print command:
   p {char*}0x80495d0

3. b *0x0804837f

4. 11 is the value returned. By using the 'info registers' command,
   you can see the value in the %eax register.
